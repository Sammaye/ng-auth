# ng-auth

An example authentication module for Angular.

It isn't brilliant but it shows quite a few principles very well, it has multi authentication funnel routing - one for user, and one for admin - with full session handling and even primative notifications.

The responses were coded against a less than satisfactory API, so ignore that coding.

Bug will be found in these forms, they were some of the first I made after learning Angular, I may update these with a much better example in the future, but this repo works really well for what it needs to do.
